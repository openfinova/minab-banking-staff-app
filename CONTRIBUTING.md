## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To keep this project legally clean and to allow the maintainer to offer commercial

We use **[CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)** to handle signatures automatically.
When you open your first pull request, a bot will comment with a link to sign the CLA
electronically. The PR cannot be merged until the CLA is signed.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a simplified [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer: e.g., Closes #123]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

fix(api): handle null response from upstream service

Closes #42
```

Rules:
- Use the **imperative mood** in the summary ("add" not "added").
- Keep the summary line under **72 characters**.
- Reference related issues in the footer when applicable.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Draft PRs are welcome** for early feedback — just mark them as draft.
2. Ensure the **CLA bot check is green** — PRs cannot be merged without a signed CLA.
3. Ensure all other CI checks pass before requesting review.
4. At least **one maintainer approval** is required to merge.
5. A maintainer may request changes — please respond or update within a reasonable timeframe.
6. Squash commits if the history is noisy before merging (maintainers may do this on merge).
7. Delete your branch after the PR is merged.
